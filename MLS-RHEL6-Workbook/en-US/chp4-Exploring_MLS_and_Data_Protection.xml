		In this scenario, Red Hat's desktop and server teams are working on the latest top-secret
developments. The developments are so top-secret, that the server team and the desktop team can't see what
each other are working on. They are both working on brand new products. In the meantime, engineering has hired them a temp to receive reports from both teams and make them more manager friendly for his supervisor. Both
teams must be careful not to leak data that the other team shouldn't have. However, these teams are allowed 
to speak of matters that both teams know of, but are still confidential elsewhere. The reports that the teams
create have the potential for containing confidential information which must be protected.

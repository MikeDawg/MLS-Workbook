	<title>Exploring MLS and Data Protection</title>
	<para>
		This lab allows us to explore some of the data protection capabilities of MLS.
	</para>
	<para>
		In this scenario, Red Hat's desktop and server teams are working on the latest top-secret
developments. The developments are so top-secret, that the server team and the desktop team can't see what
each other are working on. They are both working on brand new products. In the meantime, engineering has hired them a temp to receive reports from both teams and make them more manager friendly for his supervisor. Both
teams must be careful not to leak data that the other team shouldn't have. However, these teams are allowed 
to speak of matters that both teams know of, but are still confidential elsewhere. The reports that the teams
create have the potential for containing confidential information which must be protected.
	</para>
	<para>
		This lab will walk through the steps for working with MLS to achieve the above conditions.

						<td>Since these developments are of the highest level of secrecy, we need to
							determine what the highest level of security is now. We can do this by
							executing a listing of securtity
							compartments:<programlisting># semanage translation -l</programlisting>We
							should see that s2 is the highest level of security at "Secret." For
							this lab, we want to establish a highest level of security at s3. Keep
							in mind the Bell-LaPadula principle of "write up, read down." Adding a
							new heightened level of security should not be taken lightly. Creating a
							level of s3 to handle this data works well, but how do we keep the temp,
							server team, and desktop team from seeing each others files?<para>One
								might think that regular Linux DAC permissions would work here, but
								remember, the server and desktop teams need to be able to read what
								management writes. These are technically two different gruops. While
								ACLs would work in this situation, ACLs might not scale for our
								future needs, so we use MLS categories.</para><para>With categories,
									we can put the desktop team in s3:c1 and the server team in s3:c2.
									If we then give the temp and his supervisor s3, they will not have
									access to either of the categories, but will be at the appropriate
									level of security. Let's go ahead and set up the security level and
									categories:<programlisting># semanage translation -a -T rhsecret s3
# semanage translation -a -T rhsecret:desktop s3:c0
# semanage translation -a -T rhsecret:server s3:c1</programlisting></para></td>

						<td>Now we have some of the base layout for the system, but how do we
							determine who gets to be a part of rhsecret, rhsecret:desktop, and
							rhsecret:server? Also, how do we regulate what data these levels have
							access to? All of this needs to come about through the writing of an
							SELinux policy which establishes the rules for a new SELinux user named
							rhsecret_u who will operate in arole named rhsecret_r, which will be in
							the domain of type rhsecret_t and have access to files of type
							rhsecret_file_t. Execute the

						<td>Since SELinux roles are assigned to SELinux users, and we only want a

							make an rhsecret_u user that our users on these projects will login as.
							In orer to do this, let's add the SELinux
							user:<programlisting># semanage user -a -R "user_r rhsecret_r" \
-P rhsecret -r s0-s3:c0.c1 rhsecret_u</programlisting>This
							command added a user who can function in both the user_r and rhsecret_r
							role and can access security levels s0-s3 and categories c0 and c1 in
							s3. Keep in mind the policy: "write up, read down." If we do not give
							this SELinux user access to lower levels, we run into problems. Also
							keep in mind that even through every user signs in and gets an SELinux
